        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chicken breasts in the prepared dish. Sprinkle seasoning mix on both sides of chicken breasts; pour salsa on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is tender and juicy and the juices run clear, 25 to 35 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle chicken evenly with cheese. Continue baking until cheese is melted and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes more. Top with sour cream and serve.
